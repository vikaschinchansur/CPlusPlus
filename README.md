I am learning and practising coding of Modern C++ (version-14 and version-17). 

I have used CodeLite IDE for coding C++, it's very simple and easy to use. 
This repository contains the projects created as part of learning and coding practice, organised in sections. 
Each section covers a topic of C++ programming language.
